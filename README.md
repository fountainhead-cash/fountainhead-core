Include this project to be able to build on top of the infrastructure and contribute additional projects. All of the BitDB projects now use this repo as it makes updating projects easier. You do not need to do anything with this repository if you just want to run [bitd](https://github.com/fountainhead-cash/bitd) or [SLPDB](https://github.com/simpleledger/SLPDB).
